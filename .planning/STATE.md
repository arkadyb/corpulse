# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-04-15)

**Core value:** RAG teams can point corpulse at their vector DB and immediately understand corpus health without manual instrumentation
**Current focus:** Phase 15 planned and ready for execution

## Current Position

Phase: 15 — DSN Normalization
Plan: 15-01
Status: Planned
Last activity: 2026-04-15 — Phase 15 plan created

Progress bar: [□□□□□□□□□□] 0/6 phases complete

## Pending Todos

## Roadmap Evolution

- Phase 5 added: Address review findings in corpus health and Qdrant wrapper
- Milestone v1.1 archived on 2026-04-09; roadmap collapsed to archive links
- Milestone v1.2 roadmap created on 2026-04-10; Phases 11-14 defined
- Milestone v1.3 roadmap created on 2026-04-15; Phases 15-20 defined

## Decisions

- [Phase 11]: Pin sync report and cleanup_report stdout baselines before helper extraction.
- [Phase 11]: Use a frozen InMemoryBackend fixture for byte-for-byte report regression tests.
- [Phase 11]: Keep the new helper layer pure by accepting only pre-fetched lists, maps, and IDs rather than backend objects or formatter dependencies. — This keeps the payload builders reusable for the later async consumer without coupling them to sync-only backend calls or formatting.
- [Phase 11]: Represent the low-engagement divergence test with a tiny epsilon because Python evaluates 3 / 20 as exactly 0.15, which would not exercise the raw-vs-rounded split described in research. — The epsilon keeps the synthetic fixture aligned with the plan intent while preserving the existing helper behavior exactly.
- [Phase 11]: Reused the Plan 01 golden strings as permanent regression gates for sync formatter rewiring.
- [Phase 11]: Kept cleanup_report double-fetch behavior while moving section math into _build_cleanup_payload.
- [Phase 14]: Document AsyncCorpulse as a structured-return API with explicit sync parity notes rather than stdout-oriented wording.
- [Phase 14]: Use an inline AsyncInMemoryBackend adapter in the async demo so the example runs without external services.
